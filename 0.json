  "description": "From simply creating a post asking for advice on the Thiel Fellowship, Dharmesh Shah (https://twitter.com/dharmesh), the founder of HubSpot, offered me $100,000 for 1% of BitSwap ðŸ¤¯ http://bitswap.network/. Wow. That puts BitSwap at a $10 million valuation. Though I have a lot to consider if we begin to raise a seed round like incorporating the company and getting a bank account which is hard as a 17 year old Canadian minor. \r\n\r\nI recently got into the Management & Technology program at the University of Pennsylvania (dual degree in Wharton x Eng) though heavily considering taking a gap year to build out BitSwap, which is currently a 10 person company that I'm paying out of pocket in ethereum. Honestly, I think this is the right way to go. Planning to move into a place in DT Toronto with my cofounders Aryan & Alex. Worst case scenario I go back to Penn :) Yeet let's get this bread.\r\n\r\nEssay on maximizing serendipity: https://perell.com/essay/serendipity/\r\n\r\nOriginal Post: \r\nhttps://bitclout.com/posts/5361b6ea54e778c6d6b2c4a8f7b00da8dd7eb287ecb7138807e4d64a3dcaa966 \r\n\r\nYouTube Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnnDIcFdT6Y",
